## Inspiration
When we noticed the huge amount of sketches that were being archived at school, we thought we could give some magic and life to the sketches.

## What it does
It's a web based app which allows one to upload a sketch and makes a game out of it's pixelated analogue

## Game Rules
Your image will be magically convertedd into a map for you to play in. 
You will have 3 lives and a time limit of 90 seconds where your objective is to collect as many green coins as possible to increase your score.
You will lose a life if you touch a red block(dangerous) or if you fall off the map.
The blue blocks act like a trampoline and the black blocks are just normal blocks where you can move around.
If you lose your lives or time is up, the game will be over and your final score will be displayed.
Enjoy the game.
